# About adding sources
to add any widget from this collection, simply create a new Browser Source widget, and set the url to point to the locally hosted HTML, using port 8000 if you are using miniweb.

Ex: for the scrolling text widget, set the url to "http://localhost:8000/scrollingtext.html"

# TODOS
Honestly there are lots.  Check the individual html files for some info, or create issues here if you find a missing item you want to request!
