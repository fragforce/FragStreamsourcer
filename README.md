# About adding sources
to add any widget from this collection, simply create a new Browser Source widget, and set the url to point to the locally hosted HTML using port 8000 (by default).

Ex: for the scrolling text widget, set the url to "http://localhost:8000/scrollingtext.html"

For information on the individual overlays and what they are, check out index.htm once you've started the server.

# TODOS
Honestly there are lots.  Check the individual html files for some info, or create issues here if you find a missing item you want to request!
