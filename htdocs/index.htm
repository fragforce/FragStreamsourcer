		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			This is a mini-implementation of a go-based web service  that
			is designed to help local fragforce orgs get some neat stream widgets without having
			to rely on an external service.
		</p>
		<p>
			The system relies on the go script to pull donations from the team api and the user api records,
			and keeps them locally, while the pages use JS to read those files and display the data accordingly.  
			As this is a general webserver, additional non-data related pages can be created and used as widgets 
			as well.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Contents
		</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="/blinkingtext.html">blinkingtext.html</a> is a simple blinking text widget, configurable in
			streamlabs via custom css.  Check the html comments for use instructions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/scrollingtext.html">scrollingtext.html</a> is scrollable text that includes custom text and the last few 
			donations, made to scroll across a portion of the screen.  Text and usage configurable via YAML settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, all of the configuration for these files can be found in 
			<a href="/FSSConfig.yml">FSSConfig.yml</a> file, in YAML format.  See the comments for more information!
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/videoplay.html">videoplay.html (DEPRICATED)</a> is a simple player that auto-plays videos in the video folder,
			 useful for commercial breaks.  Configurable via YAML settings.  Though this is still usable, its better from a
			 configuration standpoint to use the VLC Source Player in OBS/SLOBS for streams.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/donationalert.html">donationalert.html (DEPRICATED)</a> is a fragforce branded alert for donations, with a
			spinning fragforce logo and sound alerts for donations, configurable via YAML Settings.  Note that 
			FRAGBOT alerts already has these alerts, so use this as a backup only.
