		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			This is a mini-implementation of a web server combined with a simple python script that
			is designed to help local fragforce orgs get some neat stream widgets without having
			to rely on an external service.
		</p>
		<p>
			The system relies on a python script to pull donations from the team api and the user api records,
			and keeps them locally, while the pages use JS to read those files and display the data accordingly.  
			As this is a general webserver, additional non-data related pages can be created and used as widgets 
			as well.

			Contents
		</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="/blinkingtext.html">blinkingtext.html</a> is a simple blinking text widget, configurable in
			streamlabs via custom css
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/donationalert.html">donationalert.html</a> is a fragforce branded alert for donations, with a
			spinning fragforce logo and sound alerts for donations, configurable via YAML Settings
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/scrollingtext.html">scrollingtext.html</a> is scrollable text that includes the last few 
			donations, designed for the bottom of the screen.  Configurable via YAML settings
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/videoplay.html">videoplay.html</a> is a simple player that auto-plays videos in the video folder,
			 useful for commercial breaks.
		</p>
		<p>
			This system also uses <a href="/dataupdate.py">a python script</a> to check and regularly update
			from DonorDrive's servers using the API, as well as build a list of videos for the player.  
			This way repeated requests in multiple widgets don't overtax the api system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, all of the configuration for these files can be found in 
			<a href="/FSSConfig.yml">FSSConfig.yml</a> file, in YAML format.  See the comments for more information!
